Team Lockedin

Mathmatical Methods for Engineers Final Project
Modeling the spread of disease and using results

This Project is Team Lockedin's final project for MAE 384. The project focuses on predicting and analyzing how a disease spreads based on predictive equations, and then using other principles we've learned in class to manipulate the data. Each part is listed below, along with the main principle used in it, and the student who was the lead programmer for that part. All students did help with multiple parts but each took charge of one part and got help from the others when needed.

Part 2 ---- Interpolation and Error ----- Jon
Part 3 ---- Least Squares Regression ---- Paige
Part 4 ---- Fourier Synthesis ----------- Gio
